        <h2><b>COVID-19 & Music</b></h2>
				<br>
				<p>According to the New York Times, at the time of this writing in early December 2020, just over 63 million people in the world have been tested positive for the virus COVID-19. At least a million and a half have died from it. Some countries have fully eradicated the virus from their land while others, like the United States, have had their number of cases grow more by the day. In the U.S. there are over 15 million positive COVID-19 cases as of today. With these dangerous numbers and hospital ICU's at capacity, California is going into another shelter-in-place. All bars, salons, outdoor dining, and large gatherings are closed and prohibited. In one swoop almost everything we know in our routines is gone. When the world and our country are dealing with a pandemic, we as individuals still have to carry on, but how we do when everything that makes up our day to day life is gone and we still have to go to work and school?</p>
        <br>
        <p>This global pandemic mixed with the loss of day-to-day activities has put a tremendous burden on our mental health. Corinna Keenmon, MD, in a Healthline article said, "We know high-stress levels have a negative impact on both mental and physical health, particularly when the stress is this prolonged." These are unprecedented times as this pandemic and our shut down has been off and on for months now. Keenmon also said that 40% of Americans are going through depression related to the pandemic. This is why things, such as music, that help our mental health are so important now more than ever. </p>
